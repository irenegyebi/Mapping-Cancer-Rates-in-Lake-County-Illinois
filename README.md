This project explores cancer incidence rates across different ZIP codes in Lake County, Illinois, using Python and geospatial analysis. By merging cancer data with geographic boundaries, we create choropleth maps to visualize the distribution of six cancer types. Additionally, we analyze data distributions using boxplots and histograms to uncover trends and disparities. The project demonstrates how data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis can provide meaningful insights for public health decision-making. Ideal for beginners, this guide walks through each step, making geospatial data science accessible and impactful.
